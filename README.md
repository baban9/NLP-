# NLP- 

In this repository, there are many NLP tasks, however, small projects which can be mixed with other approaches to make a beneficial API

This is a rework of the book Natural Language Processing Recipes - Unlocking text data with machine learning [1] and Some of the derived ideas to implement these in real world. 

I thank the Authors; Akshay Kulkarni and Adarsha Shivananda, for their book and apt explanation presented in this book which can be leveraged by beginners in NLP and get the ground running. 

Additionally, the codes here are derived from many other sources to generate solutions to perplexing problems using ML and NLP.
